**A knowledge management editor that visualizes on-chain data**

Denoted a knowledge management editor that leverages current blockchain APIs to quickly visualize on-chain data - in one single place. The vision is to facilitate the creation and sharing of on-chain data for a broad audience.

We built a WYSIWYG-editor with a clean and simple design to use immediately for any user. You start by connecting to the app through Web3Auth. When you’re connected, you’ll be able to start creating. Whenever you’re making that slash, you’re fetching from one of our many integrations. We have integrations built for Covalent, Subgraph, Tally, and Lens. Lastly, the data is saved and retrieved in ComposeDB through your decentralized identifier.
