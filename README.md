Denoted a knowledge management editor that leverages current blockchain APIs to quickly visualize on-chain data - in one single place. The vision is to facilitate the creation and sharing of on-chain data for a broad audience.

- ðŸš€ Clean and easy WYSIWYG-editor
- âœ¨ Support for multiple API integrations including Covalent, Subgraph, and Lens, etc.
- ðŸ’¾ Saved and retrieved on ComposeDB through your decentralized identity (DID)

## About

We built a WYSIWYG-editor with a clean and simple design to use immediately for any user. You start by connecting to the app through Web3Auth. When youâ€™re connected, youâ€™ll be able to start creating. Whenever youâ€™re making that slash, youâ€™re fetching from one of our many integrations. We have integrations built for Covalent, Subgraph, Tally, Dune, and Lens, etc. Lastly, the data is saved and retrieved in ComposeDB through your decentralized identifier.
